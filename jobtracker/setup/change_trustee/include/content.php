<div class="introduction">
    <ul>
        <li>For a variety of reasons a Trustee of a SMSF, family trust or unit trust may change from an individual Trustee to a Corporate Trustee or where a Trustee <br/>resigns or is replaced with another Trustee</li>
        <li>The rules of the relevant Trust or SMSF will detail the exact procedure to change the Trustee.</li>
        <li>Failure to use this formula will see any proposed change ineffective so great care must be had to ensure the procedure is reviewed and implemented. </li>
