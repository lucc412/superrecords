		<li>This document is for the preparation of a very basic planned transfer of superannuation benefits from a deceased member's account to a dependant or their legal estate.</li>
		<li>The document is binding upon the Trustee of the Fund and remains in force until the member decides to change the Binding Death Benefit Nomination.</li>
		 <li>As it is binding great care needs to be taken to ensure the Trustee and members understand what is required as it will also bind future Trustees.</li>
