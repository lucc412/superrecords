        <li>The governing rules of a super fund should be regularly upgraded to take advantage of various changes and options.</li>
        <li>In doing so great care must be taken to ensure that the variation is in accordance with the existing trust deed’s <br/>requirement for changing the rules which may require a Principal’s or Trustee’s consent.</li>
        <li>If the deed is not varied in line with the formula in the trust deed then a new trust is created and there will be a <br/>capital gains tax and stamp duty liability.</li>
