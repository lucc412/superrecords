Every key illuminates when played, and the built-in lessons utilize this functionality to visually assist you on the keyboard. It's a surprisingly fun way to learn how to play music. The LK-230 comes with a huge library of 400 playable tones, 150 beats and rhythms, and 110 songs. It's an inexpensive, feature-rich instrument that's great for learning, serious playing, and for just having a lot of fun with music. There are multiple reverb effects built into the LK-230 to sweeten the sound. You can even plug in the included microphone to amplify your voice to sing along as you play. A built-in sampler lets you record up to 10 seconds of audio with the microphone. A standard mini-plug stereo input lets you plug in an MP3 player to jam out with your favorite music. A large, easy-to-read display is prominently placed on the LK-230, so you will know what mode the keyboard is in at all times. The integrated USB port can be connected to a computer to transfer MIDI data. The LK-230 can operate via AC power or by 6 standard zinc-carbon or alkaline AA batteries (AC adapter and batteries not included).","http://www.2cis.com/images/Casio_LK-230.jpg","383","97.83970000","13.00","","Refurbished",
